# Hello World in Laminas and Laravel

Here you have a [benchmarking](benchmarking.md) with a Hello World sample implemented in Laminas and Laravel.

The skeletons of each framework were changed to reduce the homepage a one single page, without Javascript and CSS, showing only the text "Hello, World".

You will find .jmx files to reproduce performance tests in any web server you desire.
